# Full guard to take back (11.21.23)

1. **Start in Full Guard Position**: Establish a firm base.
2. **Grip Management**: Secure a same-side grip on your opponent's sleeve. If necessary, use both arms to break any counter-grip. Grip the sleeve with four fingers inside.
3. **Sleeve Manipulation**: Wrap your opponent's sleeve around your head, ensuring their elbow ends up behind your head. Utilize your legs to break your opponent's posture if needed.
4. **Head Control**: With your free arm, hug your opponent's head.
5. **Arm Positioning**: Thread the arm that was hugging the head underneath the trapped arm, then loop it over and around this arm. Continue to maintain head control with this arm.
6. **Transition Grip**: Release the grip on the sleeve and instead hug your opponent's back.
7. **Guard Break and Position Shift**: Open your guard and shift to the side opposite your initial grip.
8. **Underhook and Leg Placement**: Use your left arm to underhook beneath both of your opponent's arms, hugging them close. Simultaneously, sweep your left leg across to the outside of your opponent's leg, placing it flat, while keeping your left leg between their legs.
9. **Momentum Creation and Elbow Extraction**: Kick your right leg out to create momentum. This action assists in pulling your left elbow out.
10. **Securing Back Control**: Move to take back control from the side.
11. **Final Position - Back Mount**: Transition into a back mount, establishing a dominant position.
