## Option 1

Imagine your opponent is on your left side, attempting to take your back while you find yourself in the turtle position. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate this situation:

1. Begin by extending your left arm and firmly planting it on the ground.
2. Simultaneously, stretch your left leg out behind your opponent's right leg.
3. Next, start moving your right knee closer to your opponent's right knee.
4. At this point, you have two strategic options:

a. Utilize your left arm to execute a sweep, causing your opponent's upper body to tilt and fall to the side. As they do, transition into side control. Ensure that your left arm blocks their left arm, while your right leg provides support to execute a butt scoop, aligning your chest level with your opponent's. Apply pressure to maintain control while you posture up.

b. Alternatively, opt to land on your back, forming a V shape with your legs. Thispositioning will result in your opponent landing inside your guard, giving you an opportunity to defend effectively.

## Option 2

1. Your opponent is on your side trying to take your back and you are in turtle position.
2. Suppose your opponent is on your left side
3. Your right arm should grab your opponent's left arm's sleeve.
4. Your left leg should extend to back of your opponent's right leg.
5. With your left arm, wrapping over opponent's head and loop your opponent right armpit deep in your armpit.
6. After this, you can start to move your right knee adjacent to your opponent's right knee.
7. Put pressure on opponent's right shoulder to maintain control, again, scoop upperbody on the same level as your opponent and stay upright.
