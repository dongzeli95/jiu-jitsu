# Full guard sweep to arm bar (11.2.23)

1. **Initiating Full Guard:**
   * Start in the full guard position with you on the bottom.
2. **Gripping Technique:**
   * Secure a grip on your opponent's left sleeve. Once you have the grip, rotate your hand so that the grip is alongside the wrist.
3. **Leg Fabric Attempt:**
   * Attempt to use your left arm to grab the fabric of your opponent's right leg. If the grip is unattainable due to tight clothing or distance, contract into a crunch to draw them forward, enabling you to seize the lower part of their pants.
4. **Foot Placement:**
   * Place both feet on your opponent’s hips for control and leverage.
5. **Position Shift:**
   * Shift onto your left side, ensuring your right knee is tucked inside the sleeve grip.
6. **Shoulder Control:**
   * Position your right foot onto the opponent’s same-side shoulder, maintaining the sleeve grip.
7. **Executing the Sweep:**
   * Execute a sweep by pulling with your right hand while simultaneously pushing with your right foot against the opponent's shoulder.
8. **Post-Sweep Actions:**
   * After your opponent is swept to the ground, release the grip on their pants.
9. **Setting Up the Triangle:**
   * Slide your left foot under your opponent's head but over their right arm, setting up for a triangle choke.
10. **Adjusting for Submission:**
    * Lift your right foot and wrap it around your opponent's shoulder to tighten the triangle.
11. **Finalizing the Triangle:**
    * Execute a hip escape forward and pull your opponent towards you. At the same time, encircle your legs around your opponent's head and shoulder to secure the triangle.
12. **Arm Control:**
    * Adjust your opponent's trapped arm so that their thumb is pointing upwards, preparing for an armbar.
13. **Armbar Transition:**
    * Raise your left foot to join the right, positioning both on the same side for an armbar attempt.
14. **Securing the Armbar:**
    * Squeeze your legs together, pull on the arm, and thrust your hips upward to apply the armbar submission.
