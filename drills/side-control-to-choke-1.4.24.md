# Side Control to Choke (1.4.24)

When your opponent is in side control, attempting to frame and turn towards you, you can execute the following technique:

1. Begin by positioning the hand that's underneath your opponent's neck, turning it upside down as you aim to secure a grip.
2. Use your left arm to push your opponent's trapped head towards your stomach until your left hand is inside your opponent's right arm's bicep.
3. Try to reach and grasp your opponent's right arm's tricep.
4. Lift and extend your right leg while transitioning into a position similar to a shinbox, with your left leg stepping upright.
5. Release your grip on your opponent's trapped head and push their right arm away. Simultaneously, step your left leg to trap their right arm between your legs and lock them together.
6. Apply pressure and squeeze with your locked legs to control your opponent's arm.
7. Now, use your left arm to reach for your opponent's left collar, positioning your hand deep around their neck.
8. Rotate your legs, getting onto your knees while keeping your opponent's arm trapped securely.
9. Proceed to execute the left collar choke. If your opponent attempts to frame and push you with their left arm, allow them to do so. When their arm reaches its furthest position, use your right elbow to underhook and maintain control as you continue with the choke.
