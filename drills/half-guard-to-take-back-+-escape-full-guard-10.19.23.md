# Half guard to take back + Escape full guard (10.19.23)

### Half guard to take back

* **Positioning in Half Guard**:
  * Avoid lying flat on your back.
  * Instead, shift to your right side (or left, as needed).
  * Your head should be positioned towards your opponent's knee.
  * Maintain both hands in front of your face as a protective measure against an underhook.
* **Defending the Underhook**:
  * If the opponent attempts an underhook, use your right arm to block their left arm.
* **Securing Your Underhook**:
  * Use your left arm to underhook and secure your opponent's armpit.
* **Flattening the Opponent**:

  * Use a kick with your left leg for momentum, allowing you to pop your head out.
* **Taking the Back**:
  * Once your head is free, aim to secure the opponent's back.
  * Your right foot should remain unhooked, positioned freely inside.
* ~~<mark style="color:red;">**Wrist Control**</mark><mark style="color:red;">:</mark>~~
  * ~~<mark style="color:red;">With your left hand, grasp your opponent's right wrist using a grip where all fingers point upwards.</mark>~~
* **Executing the Roll**:
  * Fall back and initiate a roll over your right shoulder.
  * As you roll, drag the opponent down with you, simultaneously looking to secure a leg hook on their left side, ensuring back control.

### Escape full guard

**Posture in Full Guard**:

* When inside your opponent's full guard, never extend your arms above their belt. This exposes you to arm submissions.
* Initially, posture up. Curve your lower back, ensuring a strong stance that makes it challenging for your opponent to pull you down and break your posture.

**Setting Up the Grip**:

* Use your right arm to secure a same-side grip on your opponent's sleeve.
* Transition this grip by using your left hand to hold onto the sleeve, freeing your right hand.

**Breaking the Guard**:

* Step your opposite knee up (in this case, the right knee) from the arm holding the sleeve.
* On the same side that you have the sleeve grip (left side), stand up.
* After you stand up, use the other free arm to push the opponent's leg down to break the guard.
