# Escape full guard

**Posture in Full Guard**:

* When inside your opponent's full guard, never extend your arms above their belt. This exposes you to arm submissions.
* Initially, posture up. Curve your lower back, ensuring a strong stance that makes it challenging for your opponent to pull you down and break your posture.

**Setting Up the Grip**:

* Use your right arm to secure a same-side grip on your opponent's sleeve.
* Transition this grip by using your left hand to hold onto the sleeve, freeing your right hand.

**Breaking the Guard**:

* Step your opposite knee up (in this case, the right knee) from the arm holding the sleeve.
* On the same side that you have the sleeve grip (left side), use your elbow to methodically push down on your opponent's knee, working to open their full guard.

**Leg Transition**:

* Use your free arm to catch and elevate your opponent's other leg. Push it to the same side as the controlled arm, furthering your guard pass.

**Establishing Side Control**:

* As you pass the guard, move into side control. Securely hug your opponent's head with the arm that's free.
* For the other arm, your approach varies based on your opponent's positioning:
  * If the opponent's arm is tucked under their head: Slide your arm beneath their head and grip their wrist.
  * If the opponent's arm is downward: Grip their sleeve from above and place your elbow on their neck.

**Advancing Position**:

* Lift the controlled arm of the opponent. As a result, their corresponding leg will also rise.
* Pressing your knee against the side of their abdomen.

**Transitioning to Full Mount**:

* As you apply pressure and control, your opponent will likely attempt to rotate towards you in an effort to release their trapped arm.
* Utilize this movement to advance and establish a full mount position.
