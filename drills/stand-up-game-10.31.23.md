# Stand Up Game (10.31.23)

## Option 1

1. **Grip the Sleeve**: Start by grabbing your opponent's sleeve on the same side as their gripping arm, but use the hand from your opposite side.
2. **Underhook and Lift**: With your free hand, perform an underhook on their wrist. To effectively break their grip, tighten your elbow inward and intensify your underhook grip until you feel their hold weaken.
3. **Release and Position the Grip**: As you raise their arm, hold your initial sleeve grip and reposition your hand so that your knuckles face downward. This helps prevent the opponent from slipping their arm out.
4. **Move to the Back**: While maintaining control, maneuver toward your opponent's back. Secure a hold on their back belt or any fabric with your free hand, and position your foot inside your opponent's same-side foot to establish better control.
5. **Transfer the Controlled Arm**: Loop your opponent's controlled arm across to the opposite side. Then, with the hand that was originally grabbing the back belt, underhook and secure this arm.
6. **Initiate Choke**: With your other arm now free, elevate your posture and prepare for a rear naked choke. Wrap your arm around the opponent's neck and clasp their shoulder. Ensure that your elbow aligns horizontally with your opponent's nose, and use your head to press against the back of their head to apply additional pressure for the choke.

## Option 2

1. **Grip the Sleeve**: Start by grabbing your opponent's sleeve on the same side as their gripping arm, but use the hand from your opposite side.
2. **Underhook and Lift**: With your free hand, perform an underhook on their wrist. To effectively break their grip, tighten your elbow inward and intensify your underhook grip until you feel their hold weaken.
3. **Close in**: Utilize the tricep of the other arm to press against your opponent’s chest, pulling them in closer to maintain control.
4. **Arm Hook and Secure**: With your arm, hook onto your opponent’s arm, securing it tightly. Keep your elbow bent at a right angle for optimal leverage, and you may reinforce this position by using your collar to lock in the arm.
5. **Arm Bending**: With the grip still secured, use your free hand to bend your opponent’s arm, completing the setup for further control or submission techniques.
