# Half guard to take back (9.26.23)

1. **Positioning in Half Guard**:
   * Avoid lying flat on your back.
   * Instead, shift to your right side (or left, as needed).
   * Your head should be positioned towards your opponent's knee.
   * Maintain both hands in front of your face as a protective measure against an underhook.
2. **Defending the Underhook**:
   * If the opponent attempts an underhook, use your right arm to block their left arm.
3. **Securing Your Underhook**:
   * Use your left arm to underhook and secure your opponent's armpit.
4. **Flattening the Opponent**:
   * Push against the opponent's knee using your right arm to flatten them.
   * Use a kick with your left leg for momentum, allowing you to pop your head out.
5. **Taking the Back**:
   * Once your head is free, aim to secure the opponent's back.
   * Your right foot should remain unhooked, positioned freely inside.
6. **Wrist Control**:
   * With your left hand, grasp your opponent's right wrist using a grip where all fingers point upwards.
7. **Executing the Roll**:
   * Fall back and initiate a roll over your right shoulder.
   * As you roll, drag the opponent down with you, simultaneously looking to secure a leg hook on their left side, ensuring back control.
8. **Choke Setup**:
   * Slide your right arm beneath the opponent's chin, preparing for a choke.
   * For added control, grasp your opponent's shoulder using your right hand.
9. **Finishing Details**:
   * Tighten the choke by doing a shoulder shrug.
   * Position your head next to your opponent's, creating additional pressure.
