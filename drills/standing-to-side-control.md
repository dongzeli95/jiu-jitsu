# Standing to side control

1. Your opponent is down on the mat while you remain upright.
2. If your opponent is positioned on your non-dominant side (left), you need to shift to their right side to compel them to lie on that side.
3. When your opponent is on their right side, your goal is to slide your left foot under their left knee.
4. Expect your opponent to respond by placing their right foot either on your left hip or left leg.
5. Secure a grip on your opponent's foot with your left hand. Squat down without leaning forward. Upon rising from the squatting position, pull their leg to the side.
6. Next, squat forward and place your left knee on the ground while hooking your opponent's left thigh inside your left foot.
7. Release your grip on their left foot and target their right armpit to execute an underhook. If your opponent resists, insert your left elbow to ensure you isolate their right arm, preventing them from using it defensively.
8. In case your opponent pushes against your left knee, transition into a shin box position, exerting pressure on your left shoulder.
9. Secure a grip on your opponent's left sleeve with your right hand. Pull it upward to straighten it, all while pressing your left knee against their body to maintain a snug hold.
10. With your left knee firmly pressed against your opponent's body, rotate your own body and aim for side control, with your right hand wrapping around their head.
