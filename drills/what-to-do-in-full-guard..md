# What to do in full guard.

## Option 1

1. First, sit back and firmly grip your opponent's pants. Remember to position your wrist in an upward bend to prevent your opponent from grabbing your sleeve and injuring your wrist. Keep your elbow extended outward.
2. With your back straight, lift yourself up, ensuring that your left knee is directed towards your opponent's buttocks.
3. Now, shift your right knee to the rear-right side while simultaneously pressing your right elbow against your opponent's knee to break their guard.
4. Once the guard is broken, use your right hand to go for an underhook.
5. Bring both knees up and apply pressure to your opponent while moving towards the right.
6. Simultaneously, use your right hand to grasp your opponent's right collar deeply, near the back of their neck, with your four fingers outside and your thumb inside the collar.
7. Apply pressure in a way that forces your opponent's leg to bend towards their nose. Your right elbow should be as close to the ground as possible, maintaining pressure against your opponent's neck.
8. Continue applying pressure until your opponent gives up their leg to the side.
9. Maintain forward pressure to keep control, especially if your opponent attempts to turn towards you.

### Option 2

1. First, lean back and firmly grip your opponent's pants. It's crucial to maintain an upward bend in your wrist to prevent your opponent from grabbing your sleeve and potentially injuring your wrist. Keep your elbow straight and extended outward.
2. Anticipate that your opponent may attempt to grab your collar. When they do, execute a cross grip technique. Secure a tight grip with all four fingers in and use your other hand to grab your opponent's elbow, creating a 2-on-1 control.
3. Shift your opponent's arm to the side of your cross grip.
4. Elevate yourself, ensuring that your knee on the opposite side is raised.
5. Position both your elbows inside your opponent's knees.
6. Extend your grip toward you, ensuring that your elbow is snugly tucked inside your opponent's knee.
7. Utilize your elbow to exert pressure against your opponent's knee, gradually breaking their guard.
8. As soon as the guard is open, swiftly transition to an underhook position with your other arm.
9. Apply pressure to move your opponent to the side, creating an opportunity for side control.
10. Secure the underhook around your opponent's neck, establishing control and dominance in the match.
