# Back defense & offense

## Back defense

1. Start by gripping the sleeve over your shoulder and choose the side to fall towards. Avoid falling backward; instead, aim to roll to the side.
2. Suppose you decide to roll to the left side; in that case, reach for your opponent's left foot and extend your left leg straight and step over to break the hook.
3. Rotate to your right, ensuring you don't tip over backward.
4. Break the opponent's seatbelt grip by inserting your left hand inside the grip and using both hands to create leverage and push it apart.
5. Once the grip is broken, seize your opponent's left sleeve, sliding all four fingers inside the outer sleeve of their left hand.
6. Raise your arm overhead and position your right elbow against your opponent's chest to prevent them from posturing up.
7. Utilize your left grip to secure your opponent's left arm against your neck's side for an armbar opportunity.
8. Slide your right arm under your opponent's left arm, reaching across to the opposite side of their neck. Simultaneously, bend their left arm and transfer it to your right hand. Ensure a tight grip by grabbing as deep as possible on their forearm with your right hand.
9. Grab your opponent's side fabric near their upright knee.
10. Execute a hip escape to completely remove their hooks.
11. Turn to the side and push forward, transitioning into a dominant side control position.

## Back offense

1. Position yourself on your opponent's back.
2. When your opponent starts to tilt to the side of your shoulder, promptly remove your leg from their hook to maintain balance.
3. Next, extend your left leg and adjust your angle so that your opponent's head rests on your left thigh, while your right foot hooks onto their left knee.
4. Reach out with your right hand and secure a deep grip on your opponent's cross collar.
5. Simultaneously, use your other arm to reach down and push on the opposite collar.
6. Lean back further, applying pressure to initiate a choke on your opponent.
7. If the choke isn't feasible, you can transition to an armbar from this position. Release your right foot from the hookand place it over your opponent's body. Extend your left leg over your opponent's head, secure their arm, and execute the armbar.
