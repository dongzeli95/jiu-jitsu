# Side Control Escape (9.21.23)

## Option 1

1. **Initiating the Escape from Bottom Side Control**: When you're on the bottom in side control, begin your escape by addressing your opponent's position.
2. **Establishing Grips on Opponent's Shoulders**: Use one arm to press against your opponent's near shoulder while your other hand grabs the far shoulder. This establishes initial control and begins the process of creating space.
3. **Clearing the Head**: By pulling down on the shoulders, create enough space to extract your head from beneath your opponent.
4. **Underhooking**: The arm that was pressing against the opponent's near shoulder should now shoot under the opponent's torso, attempting to establish an underhook. This underhook is pivotal for many escapes, including the one you're detailing.
5. **Hand Gripping and Head Movement**: Once the underhook is in place, use both hands to secure a strong grip on your opponent, and continue moving your head towards the far side, sliding it under the opponentâ€™s body.
6. **Securing the Far Side Armpit**: As your head emerges on the far side, your free hand (the one not underhooking) should reach and secure a grip on your opponent's far armpit. This will assist in controlling your opponent's posture and movement.
7. **Finalizing the Escape**: With both grips secured and your head free, exert pressure against your opponent's trapped arm, further destabilizing their base.
8. **Transition to the Turtle Position**: Using the momentum and the space created, rotate your body and move into a turtle position but with you on top, effectively reversing the initial position.

## Option 2

**1-3 Initiating the Escape from Bottom Side Control**: Start by addressing your opponent's position when you're on the bottom in side control.

4. **Establishing the Underhook**: Use one arm to press against your opponent's near shoulder, then slip this arm under your opponent's torso, aiming to get an underhook. This is a pivotal step for many escapes, ensuring you have some leverage and control against the top player.
5. **Positioning the Free Arm**: With your other arm (the one that's not establishing the underhook), place it across to the opposite side of your opponent's head. This sets up the subsequent movement and potentially creates space for your head.
6. **Slipping the Head Out**: Utilize the space created by your arm positioning to slip your head under and past your opponent's torso. Continue this movement until your head is completely out on the opposite side, creating an angle where you can potentially attack or further escape.
7. **Setting up the Arm Triangle**: As you move forward, slip further towards your opponent's head. With the arm that's on the opposite side of their head, reach around to grab your other bicep. This positioning is the beginning of an arm triangle setup. Make sure to keep pressure and ensure your opponent's arm is trapped correctly.
