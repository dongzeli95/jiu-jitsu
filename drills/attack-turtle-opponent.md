# Attack turtle opponent

## Side control

1. Your opponent assumes the turtle position, with you firmly gripping them using your right arm while positioning yourself on their left side.
2. Ensure that your right knee is snugly pressed against your opponent's left knee, with your knee slightly positioned behind theirs.
3. Shift your weight back onto your right ankle while maintaining a low center of gravity. Simultaneously, elevate your left leg to a 90-degree angle.
4. Employ your left hand to guide your opponent's left hand inward, facilitating a secure grip with your right hand.
5. Apply pressure in the direction of your opponent's right side, harnessing the power of your left leg to generate momentum and flatten your adversary.
6. As a result, your opponent will end up on your left arm, enabling you to smoothly transition into a side control position.
