# Bottom guard sweep (12.21.23)

Begin in the bottom position, assuming the guard position. If your opponent's left foot is forward, position yourself on your left side; otherwise, align yourself on your right side.

1. Place both of your feet on your opponent's hip, ankle, or around their knee, ideally with your right foot on your opponent's left hip.
2. Reach for the lower part of your opponent's left leg pants with your left hand, on the outside of your own left leg.
3. Secure a cross grip on your opponent's right sleeve using your right hand.
4. Now, place your right foot on your opponent's left hip and position your left foot behind your opponent's left knee.
5. When your opponent takes a step forward with their right leg, execute the sweep by pulling on the grips and pushing their hip.
6. It's essential to maintain a straight alignment with your opponent in this guard position; if they are too close and at an angle to your left, this technique won't be effective.

## Offense Cycle

Following the successful sweep, sit up while maintaining your grip on both the pants and the sleeve. Ensure that your left foot remains positioned underneath your opponent's knee.

7. Gently guide your arm inside your opponent's crouch area.
8. Employ a shin box technique to maintain control.
9. Continue to apply pressure forward, gradually flattening your opponent, and then transition into a side control position.
