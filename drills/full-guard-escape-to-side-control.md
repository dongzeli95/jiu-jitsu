# Full guard escape to side control

## Option 1

this technique was mentioned before, stick your knee to opponent's butt and stretch the other leg on rear right to break the guard and then underhook with the same side arm, move on toes to put pressure on opponent until you are on side of opponent and go for side control.

## Option 2

Same as before once you break the guard.

* Instead of underhook on one side, you underhook both arm on both sides to loop around opponent's legs.
* Do a gable grip, move your shifted knee inside.
* Pull opponent's hip towards you and elevate them entirely until their hip is above your both legs.
* Now move your one side knee to the side 90 degree angle.
* Drop opponent on that side to go for side control.
