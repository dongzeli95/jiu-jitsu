# Pass De La Riva Guard (08.06.24)

* **Control Opponent's Non-Hooking Leg**: Press down on the opponent's leg that is not hooking yours to begin destabilizing their position.
* **Knee Placement**: Drop your knee on the same side to the mat, pressing it against the opponent's buttocks to limit their mobility.
* **Shift Opponent's Leg**: Push the controlled leg to the opposite side of where you dropped your knee to further compromise their guard.
* **Secure Positioning**: Drop your other knee to the mat and press your shin against the opponent's leg to secure them in place.
* **Stack and Underhook**: Stack on the opponent by shifting your weight forward and secure an underhook on the opponent's arm with a firm grip.
* **Apply Pressure and Rotate**: Maintain weight pressure on the opponent and rotate towards the underhooked arm to start passing the guard.
* **Knee on Belly**: Move into a knee-on-belly position to stabilize your control and prepare for the transition to full mount.
* **Achieve Full Mount**: Drive forward into full mount, ensuring to come up higher so your knees squeeze near the opponent's head, restricting their movement.
* **Prepare for Arm Bar**: Rotate your left and right feet, positioning yourself to sit on the opponent. This sets up the angle for an arm bar submission.
* **Finish with Arm Bar**: Bring your other foot over the opponent's face and secure the arm bar by extending their arm and applying pressure.
