# Triangle Defense / Full Guard Sweep (9.19.23)

## Triangle Choke Defense

**Initial Position:**

* Your opponent has locked in a triangle choke with their right leg, trapping your right arm inside the triangle.

**Secure your Position:**

* Use your trapped right arm to grasp your opponent's belt or gi, pulling your arm tight against their leg to minimize their control and reduce pressure on your carotid artery.

**Stabilizing Hand Position:**

* With your left hand, make an overhand grip on your right wrist. This provides additional reinforcement, keeping your trapped arm snug against your opponent's leg.

**Protecting the Neck:**

* Turn your head to the side opposite of the leg that's around your neck. This positioning can create a slight gap and reduce the choking pressure.
* Simultaneously, keep your head up and begin to correct your posture, making it more upright. This helps in alleviating some of the choke pressure.

**Escaping the Choke:**

* Stand up with strong posture. Use the combined strength of your legs and core to rise, ensuring you maintain your grips and head positioning.
* With the leverage of your upright posture and grips, vigorously shake and pull your head to break free from the triangle.

**Transition to Dominant Position:**

* Once free, grip your opponent's collar and immediately look to establish side control, capitalizing on the momentum from your escape.

## Full guard sweep

**Initial Grip:**

* From the full guard position, secure a double grip on your opponent's left sleeve with both of your hands.

**Setting Up the Sweep:**

* Slide your left hand under your opponent's right leg, preparing to off-balance them for the sweep.
* If your opponent anticipates the sweep, their natural reaction might be to posture up or stand to prevent being swept.

**Transition to Feet-on-Hips:**

* As your opponent postures up or stands, immediately place both of your feet on their hips.
* With your **left** hand, grab the collar of your opponent, focusing on the top part near their opposite shoulder (this should be the left collar since you're still holding their left sleeve with your right hand). This opposite-side collar grip is vital as it restricts their ability to rotate and escape.

**Adjustment for the Takedown:**

* Shift your left foot's position so it hooks behind your opponent's right knee.
* Release your grip from the collar, and with your left hand, secure a grip on your opponent's right ankle, preferably near the heel for better control.
* Now, simultaneously push with your right foot on their hip while pulling with your right hand on the sleeve. This will off-balance your opponent, leading to a takedown.

**Transitioning to Side Control:**

* Once your opponent is down, maintain control by switching your left hand's grip to their left sleeve.
* Use your right hand to either grip the fabric of your opponent's pants or to go underneath and grab the ankle.
* Guide or "shovel" their leg towards the left, clearing a path for you to transition smoothly into a dominant side control position.
